# DebugKit

A library for cross-target fully-encapsulated debugging controls. Heavy work-in-progress.

## Background

I ran into a problem at work where I wanted to be able to provide a unifying set of tools for surfacing debugging controls for all of our client apps and libraries, but without requiring those controls to be exposed as part of each library's public interface. DebugKit aims to solve those problems by pushing as much as possible into implementation details that can be private to the target, while maintaining a very light and easy-to-use public interface. 

## Usage

_Coming soon!_
